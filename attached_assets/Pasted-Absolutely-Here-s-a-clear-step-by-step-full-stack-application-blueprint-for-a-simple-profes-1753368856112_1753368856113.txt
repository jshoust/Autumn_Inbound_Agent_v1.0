Absolutely! Here’s a clear, step-by-step **full-stack application blueprint** for a **simple, professional inbound driver recruiting agent** built on Replit, using:

* **ElevenLabs Voice Agent** (already handling calls/IVR)
* **Node.js/Express** backend for webhooks and database logic
* **PostgreSQL** for storing candidate and call info
* **React** frontend for basic review/admin/log viewing

This is focused on simplicity, professionalism, and easy expansion.
Copy/paste and adapt as needed.

---

## 1. System Overview

* **Inbound call** → ElevenLabs Agent → Webhook (your backend)
* **Backend** receives and parses call/candidate data, stores to **Postgres**
* **Simple React UI** lets recruiters view recent calls, review parsed data, and mark candidates as qualified/disqualified

---

## 2. Basic Architecture

```
[ElevenLabs Voice Agent] 
        |
     (Webhook)
        |
[Express API Backend] -- [Postgres]
        |
      (REST)
        |
   [React Frontend]
```

---

## 3. Feature List

* **Inbound webhook endpoint** to receive call events (from ElevenLabs)
* **Candidate parsing & scoring** (logic to judge qualification based on answers)
* **Postgres data storage**: candidate info, call log, agent decisions
* **Minimal admin UI**: List recent calls, see candidate data, quick “Qualified / Not Qualified” buttons

---

## 4. Technologies

* **Backend**: Node.js, Express, [pg](https://www.npmjs.com/package/pg) (Postgres client)
* **Frontend**: React (Vite or Create React App), Tailwind (optional)
* **Database**: PostgreSQL (on Replit or external)
* **Notifications**: (Optional) Twilio/Sendgrid for follow-ups
* **Deployment**: All hosted on Replit

## 5. Full Markdown for REPLIT

Below is a full project scaffold—**edit to match your fields and logic**.

---

### `/backend/server.js`

```js
const express = require('express');
const cors = require('cors');
const { Pool } = require('pg');
require('dotenv').config();

const app = express();
app.use(cors());
app.use(express.json());

const pool = new Pool({
  connectionString: process.env.DATABASE_URL
});

// --- Webhook: Receive call/candidate data from ElevenLabs ---
app.post('/api/inbound', async (req, res) => {
  // Example: Parse candidate data sent in ElevenLabs payload
  const { call_id, transcript, phone, answers } = req.body;

  // Basic qualification scoring logic (customize)
  let qualified = false;
  if (answers && answers.cdl === true && answers.experience >= 2) qualified = true;

  // Save to DB
  await pool.query(
    `INSERT INTO candidates (call_id, phone, transcript, answers, qualified, created_at)
     VALUES ($1, $2, $3, $4, $5, NOW())`,
    [call_id, phone, transcript, answers, qualified]
  );

  res.status(200).json({ status: 'ok' });
});

// --- Get recent candidates (for React admin) ---
app.get('/api/candidates', async (req, res) => {
  const result = await pool.query(
    'SELECT * FROM candidates ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 100'
  );
  res.json(result.rows);
});

// --- Update candidate qualification status (manual override) ---
app.post('/api/candidate/:id/qualify', async (req, res) => {
  const { id } = req.params;
  const { qualified } = req.body;
  await pool.query('UPDATE candidates SET qualified=$1 WHERE id=$2', [qualified, id]);
  res.json({ success: true });
});

app.listen(3001, () => console.log('API listening on 3001'));
```

---

### `/backend/schema.sql`

*(run this to create your candidates table)*

```sql
CREATE TABLE IF NOT EXISTS candidates (
  id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
  call_id TEXT,
  phone TEXT,
  transcript TEXT,
  answers JSONB,
  qualified BOOLEAN,
  created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

---

### `/frontend/src/App.jsx`

```jsx
import React, { useEffect, useState } from "react";

function App() {
  const [candidates, setCandidates] = useState([]);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("http://localhost:3001/api/candidates")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(setCandidates);
  }, []);

  const handleQualify = (id, qualified) => {
    fetch(`http://localhost:3001/api/candidate/${id}/qualify`, {
      method: "POST",
      headers: { "Content-Type": "application/json" },
      body: JSON.stringify({ qualified })
    }).then(() => {
      setCandidates(candidates =>
        candidates.map(c => c.id === id ? { ...c, qualified } : c)
      );
    });
  };

  return (
    <div className="max-w-2xl mx-auto p-8">
      <h1 className="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Recent Driver Candidates</h1>
      <table className="w-full border">
        <thead>
          <tr>
            <th>Phone</th>
            <th>Transcript</th>
            <th>Qualified?</th>
            <th>Action</th>
          </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
          {candidates.map(c => (
            <tr key={c.id}>
              <td>{c.phone}</td>
              <td><pre>{c.transcript?.slice(0, 120) || ""}</pre></td>
              <td>
                {c.qualified === true ? "✅" : c.qualified === false ? "❌" : "—"}
              </td>
              <td>
                <button onClick={() => handleQualify(c.id, true)} className="mr-2">✅</button>
                <button onClick={() => handleQualify(c.id, false)}>❌</button>
              </td>
            </tr>
          ))}
        </tbody>
      </table>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;
```

---

### `/frontend/package.json` *(install)*

```json
{
  "name": "driver-recruit-ui",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "dependencies": {
    "react": "^18.0.0",
    "react-dom": "^18.0.0"
  }
}
```

---

### `.env` (for backend—never expose this in frontend!)

```
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://username:password@host:5432/dbname
```

---

## 6. How It Works

1. **ElevenLabs** is configured to send webhook events (including parsed answers) to `/api/inbound`
2. **Backend** receives payload, runs basic scoring, logs to Postgres
3. **React UI** displays recent candidate calls, basic data, allows quick override of qualification status
4. (Optional) Expand: Send SMS or email to qualified candidates, add search, etc.

---

## 7. Notes

* **Qualification logic**: Customize `qualified = ...` section based on your screening requirements.
* **Answers**: Structure depends on what ElevenLabs sends (parse their webhook payload to fit your DB columns).
* **Security**: Add basic authentication to React and API before going live.
* **Scaling**: The code is intentionally minimal and expandable for your needs.

Let me know if you need:

* ElevenLabs webhook payload example parsing
* Example Dockerfile or Replit setup
* Live deployment steps
  Or any specific UI/logic enhancement!

This will get you started quickly, and you can polish further as you go.
