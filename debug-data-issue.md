# Debug Guide - Finding Your Data

## 🔍 **ISSUE IDENTIFIED**

Your data is likely in the **old `candidates` table**, but the **new UI was looking in the `call_records` table**.

## 🛠️ **SOLUTION APPLIED**

I've updated the UI to use the `/api/candidates` endpoint temporarily so you can see your existing data.

## 🧪 **TEST THESE ENDPOINTS**

### Check Candidates Endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/candidates
```

### Check Call Records Endpoint:
```bash
curl http://localhost:5000/api/call-records
```

## 🎯 **WHAT TO EXPECT**

**If `/api/candidates` has data but `/api/call-records` is empty:**
- ✅ **CONFIRMED**: Data is in old table
- ✅ **SOLUTION**: UI now uses candidates data
- ✅ **RESULT**: You should see your data in the new table UI

**If both endpoints are empty:**
- ❓ **POSSIBLE**: No data has been stored yet
- ❓ **CHECK**: Have any webhook calls been received?
- ❓ **VERIFY**: Database connection and table existence

## 🔄 **CURRENT STATUS**

The new dynamic table UI now:
- ✅ **Fetches data** from `/api/candidates` (your existing data)
- ✅ **Converts format** to work with new table structure
- ✅ **Shows dynamic columns** based on your data
- ✅ **Displays pass/fail** agent results

## 🎉 **EXPECTED RESULT**

If you have data in the candidates table, you should now see it displayed in the new dynamic table format on your home page!

## 🔧 **NEXT STEPS**

1. **Check the home page** - your data should now appear
2. **If still empty** - run the curl commands above to verify data location
3. **For new calls** - they'll need the webhook configured to populate either table

The table will automatically adapt to whatever data structure you have in the candidates table.
